In addition to the features that are auto-graded, the graphical user interface
of our project implements the following features:

 - A simple placement viewer (Task 4), easily accessible with one click of the button 'Viewer'
 - A basic playable game that snaps pieces to the board and checks for validity (Task 7)
 - Moving the piece with ease using lighten colour and freely adjustable drag & drop
 - A 'Restart' button, among with a confirmation dialog
 - Highlighted centre zone for a higher score
 - Error dialogs indicating users illegal operations
 - A tips dialog presenting insights for scoring high 
 - The 'Generate' button automatically checks whatever there're further legal moves, and will only roll a new dice if there's none
